# OCW Minecraft Servers [![Main Build](https://github.com/Nincodedo/rhc-ocw/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nincodedo/rhc-ocw/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is the current server orchestration for OCW's Minecraft servers. It
uses [itzg's Minecraft Docker image](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server).

## Minecraft Radical Hardcore

Radical Hardcore (RHC) starts up a Minecraft server in Hardcore mode with one additional rule. If anyone dies, the
entire server is wiped and started anew.
