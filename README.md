# Minecraft Radical Hardcore [![Main Build](https://github.com/Nincodedo/rhc-ocw/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nincodedo/rhc-ocw/actions/workflows/build.yml)
Radical Hardcore (RHC) starts up a Minecraft server in Hardcore mode with one additional rule. If anyone dies, the entire server is wiped and started anew. This is also the current server orchestration of OCW Minecraft.
