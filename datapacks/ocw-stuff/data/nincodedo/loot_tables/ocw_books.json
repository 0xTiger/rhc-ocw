One such follower was Greg, who had become close friends with another known as Zedar, who had not been\"}','{\"text\":\"chosen for a blessing. In time, however, the gods acknowledged him, and made him an equal with Greg. However, despite their friendship, Greg was angry at this decision, thinking Zedar unworthy of the power, though he held his tongue. For a time, peace\"}','{\"text\":\"prevailed in the world. That is, until the day Greg learned that Zedar had committed an act of great evil against him. Their friendship was broken, and Greg\\'s relationship with the gods was also strained, as they did not see fit to exile Zedar for his\"}','{\"text\":\"crime. After many weeks and much pleading on Zedar\\'s part, Greg was persuaded to relent, though the friendship was far from repaired. In time, things slowly began to return to normal, but new problems were brewing. Zedar acted foolishly, all unawares,\"}','{\"text\":\"which served to anger Greg, who still held his tongue. Beyond that, Zedar had become bored with the world he was charged to take care of, and began to misuse his powers for amusement at the expense of the inhabitants, and often to the unspoken\"}','{\"text\":\"exasperation of the gods. Finally, the foolishness became too much to bear, and Greg once again swore to never associate with Zedar, or the gods, again. Still not realizing his fault, Zedar tried many times to appease his former friend, to no avail,\"}','{\"text\":\"though Greg\\'s relationship with the gods was slowly re-established. As that year was drawing to a close, Zedar, finally realizing his fault and overcome with remorse, tried one last time to beg forgiveness from Greg. For reasons unknown even to\"}','{\"text\":\"himself, Greg chose to relent, one last time. Once again, the friendship was renewed, slowly at first, but within a month it was almost as if nothing had come between the two. Zedar proved himself to have changed for the better, though he had long since\"}','{\"text\":\"left the world of Minecraft behind, as even the cruel amusements had become tiresome. Months passed, and the gods began to prepare the world for change. Greg joined them in this, but warned them that Zedar would certainly return soon,\"}','{\"text\":\"no doubt wreaking havoc as he had the previous year. As predicted, Zedar appeared a short time before the changes were to take place, but it soon became clear that he had no intention of returning to his old ways. Pleased by this, the gods chose not to\"}','{\"text\":\"strip Zedar of his power, as Greg had counseled. When the changes took place and the world renewed, Zedar was absent for a time. When he finally reappeared, he retained his power, much to Greg\\'s anger. Unaware that the gods had relented, Greg\"}','{\"text\":\"vented his rage at Zedar, claiming that he was despised by all the gods and their other followers, which had been true before, but no longer. Zedar said nothing, but simply waited. However, Greg\\'s wrath only increased. Since the gods had not acted, Greg\"}','{\"text\":\"chose to pass judgement in their stead. He stripped Zedar of his power, in addition to two others for whom he held distaste. Still Zedar made no response, except to inform the gods of what had happened. In that instant the wrath of the gods was kindled\"}','{\"text\":\"against Greg, and he was forever banished from the land. However, Zedar asked for mercy, since his previous behavior was the cause of Greg\\'s wrath. The gods relented, and Greg was allowed to return, though only with diminished power. Upon his return,\"}','{\"text\":\"however, Greg paid no heed to the mercy granted to him, only choosing to see the punishment. After exchanging heated words with the gods, Greg did the unthinkable. Certain that he would never return in any case, Greg unleashed the ancient, forbidden\"}','{\"text\":\"power known as Vulcan upon the city of OCWville, the first and only settlement in the new world. In a fury, he pulverized the marketplace, also catching the tavern and the smithy in the blast. The gods quickly retaliated, banishing Greg once more. There\"}','{\"text\":\"would be no more mercy. However, the damage had already been done. The market was a smoking ruin, and the other buildings had to be completely rebuilt. Fortunately, Greg had not had time to turn his attention to the rest of the town, so the process of\"}','{\"text\":\"rebuilding was relatively short. The friendship between Greg and Zedar, however, was broken once more, as was the link between him and the gods. It is thought to be highly unlikely for either to be repaired. The gods were adamant that the second\"}','{\"text\":\"banishment be permanent, and Greg\\'s actions did not endear him to his now-former friend. Nonetheless, reconciliation may be possible after some time, but this event, this Happened, will not soon be forgotten.\"}']}"
